Gradify is a handy student database application. It is designed specifically for teachers, administrators and other education professionals who need tools to manage their learning process.
In Gradify, you can easily add, edit, and delete student records, including their name, date of birth, contact information, academic performance, and grades.
Gradify also provides quick access to student information through a user-friendly interface. You can quickly search for a student by name, group, or other criteria, and filter the data by various criteria.
